# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# Task Manager

## Overview

- Mark tasks as completed/pending
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- API routes for task management

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint for code quality

### Backend:
- Node.js & Express.js
- MongoDB 
- JWT Authentication

## What We Did in This Project
### **Frontend Development**
- Designed a responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Implemented routing and state management in React
- Integrated API calls to the backend

### **Backend Development**
- Set up an Express server with Node.js
- Created RESTful APIs for managing tasks
- Implemented authentication with JWT

### **Database Management**
- Defined Mongoose schemas for tasks and users
- Connected to a MongoDB database

### **Deployment & Optimization**
- Deployed the frontend on Vercel/Netlify
- Deployed the backend on Render/Heroku/AWS

### **steps to start the project**
1) clone the project in any folder directory
2) open the frontend folder in vs code
3) in that file terminal run npm i
4) open backend folder in seperate vs code 
5) in that file terminal run npm i express and npm i nodemon
6) run npm run dev in both vs code windows and if all set you will see a local host link in front end vs code and App started listing and db connected in backend vs code terminals

### **cloning the project**
1) Open your cmd terminal 
   Press window key > type cmd and open it
2) write -> cd Desktop 
3) Then write -> git clone https://github.com/Aarizkhan-lorem/TaskManager.git
4) then follow the next steps accordingly
